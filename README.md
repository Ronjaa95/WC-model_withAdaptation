# WC-model_withAdaptation
In this framework, the neurolib-repository by https://github.com/neurolib-dev/neurolib is expanded by a Wilson-Cowan model with a hyperpolarizing adaptation mechanism, generating slow oscillations in a connectome.

The additional provided notebooks are visualizations and computations of the data acqusition on slow oscialltions. The python-sripts are the derivation functions, to gather certain aspects of the model, provide nullcline-, and fixed point derivations for the single node mode (linear stability analysis), as well as a bistability analysis on the whole-brain-network (numerical stability analysis.) DataFrame computation functions are only templates, on how to initialize such a derivation.
